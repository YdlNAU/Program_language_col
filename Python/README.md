# Python study progress and the materials

Record the progress on studying Python programing

My programming study strategy is following the description below:

* Not study step by step: You first know the data type and than know the functions ! No it's for high school student or undergraduate.  
* Follow the repo *perl_progress_everyday* : That means you should find the solution of Perl routines in Python
* Project-based learning

Short letters about Perl are in the `Jian Shu` http://www.jianshu.com/nb/10284685
